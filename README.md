Welcome to the Camper Cafe project, created as part of the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. This project focuses on building a website for a fictional coffee shop called "Camper Cafe." The purpose of this project is to showcase the skills and knowledge acquired through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum, specifically in the area of web development.

## Project Description

Camper Cafe is a responsive and interactive website for a coffee shop that offers a cozy and relaxing environment for campers and coffee enthusiasts. The website is designed to provide users with information about the cafe's menu, opening hours, and contact details. Users can also explore the cafe's social media presence and subscribe to the cafe's newsletter.

## Features

- **Home Page:** The home page welcomes users with a warm and inviting atmosphere, featuring high-quality images of the cafe's interior, outdoor seating, and signature coffee offerings.

- **Menu:** The menu page showcases the cafe's diverse range of coffee drinks, pastries, and snacks. Each menu item is accompanied by a mouthwatering description and pricing.

- **Location:** Users can easily find the cafe's location using an interactive map. The address, along with a brief description of the neighborhood, helps users plan their visit.
